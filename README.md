# aspnet-mongodb-example
Example ASP.NET (.NET 6) application that accesses MongoDB. Uses simple API with a Vue front-end.

There's also a [post on this application that goes into more detail](https://www.adamrussell.com/aspnet-mongodb-example).

A screenshot of the application (though the code will be more interesting to anyone):
